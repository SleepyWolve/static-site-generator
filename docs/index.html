Maybe it's a bit odd, but one of the harder parts for me was that I wasn't sure what to name functions or variables, or which file to put them in. I plan on returning to this project when I know a lot more about programming, I might rewrite it in a different language.</p><h2>Goals</h2><p>Ideas I would add when returning to this project - [ ] Automatically handle some errors - [ ] Come up with more ideas - [ ] IDK - [ ] Write in rust, so it runs faster or something</p><h2>More Formatting Examples</h2><p>paragraph with <b>bold, *bolded* _italic_</b>, and <i>italic</i> goes here newline, <code>with code</code></p><blockquote>quote with <b>BOLD text</b> quote with <i>italic text</i> quote with <b>_Bolded Italic text_</b></blockquote><h3>Very Effective Code</h3><p>Not sure why I wrote this much :shrugs:</p><pre><code>y
string = ""
def main():
    set_str("Hello World!")
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(f"{i}. {string}")
        i += 1        
def set_str(i):
    print("Setting String...")
    global string
    string = i
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
</code></pre><p>oh, it seems it doesn't handle this correctly when there is recurring newlines within the code block</p><h6>Smallest Header thingy</h6><p>That's all folx</p></div></article>
