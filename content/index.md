## Thoughts

### 21/March/2025

I finished this project yesterday, and it was hard. Maybe it's a bit odd, but one of the harder parts for me was that I wasn't sure what to name functions or variables, or which file to put them in. I plan on returning to this project when I know a lot more about programming, I might rewrite it in a different language.

## Goals

Ideas I would add when returning to this project
- str[ ] Automatically handle some errors
- str[ ] Come up with more ideas
- str[ ] IDK
- str[ ] Write in rust, so it runs faster or something

possible problem with `regex`

## More Formatting Examples

paragraph with **bold, *bolded* _italic_**, and _italic_ goes here
newline, `with code` 

> quote with **BOLD text**
> quote with _italic text_
> quote with **_Bolded Italic text_**

### Very Effective Code

Not sure why I wrote this much :shrugs:

```py
string = ""
def main():
    set_str("Hello World!")
    i = 1
    while i <= 10:
        print(f"{i}. {string}")
        i += 1        
def set_str(i):
    print("Setting String...")
    global string
    string = i
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

oh, it seems it doesn't handle this correctly when there is recurring newlines within the code block
